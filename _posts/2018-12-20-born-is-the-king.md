Watch the concert where it all began! This is the day we put together our first
little concert that sparked the idea for ASC. We are so amazed that this small
idea eventually grew into becoming everything that Arizona Saints Chorale is
now: an organization dedicated to sharing the light of Christ through song AND
by serving the poor and needy.
