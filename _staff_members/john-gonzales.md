John Gonzales, a California native, has sung in and conducted choirs since high
school madrigals. Currently a senior pursuing a second bachelor's degree in
general music and choral education at Mesa Community College and Ottawa
University, John plans to engender the love of music into elementary age
children after he graduates. John also composes music and teacher guitar and
piano to beginning and intermediate students. He is especially grateful to learn
from the other conductors this first year of his directorship with the Arizona
Saints Chorale. He loves devoting his time to his faith, his lovely wife Sarah,
his friends and family, playing sports, and writing music.
