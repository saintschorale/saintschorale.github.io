## Introduction

You made it! Most people do not bother reading privacy policies, so we are glad
you are taking the time to do so. We will attempt to make it as straightforward
of an experience as possible for the both of us.

We are a musical organization seeking to make the world a better place. We care
deeply about digital privacy and reject the idea that software must have access
to invasive amounts of data to function properly.

That said, some of our products have the ability to collect data about the
people using them. We always keep this data collection to a minimum, and, where
possible, make it an "opt-in" process. We have never sold user data and never
will.

We reserve the right to integrate some third-party services into our products
projects that are not so noble in their use of your data (e.g. Google Analytics,
Google AdSense, Facebook Ads, etc.). These services help us identify ways to
improve our products in a cost-effective way.

We share these guiding principles first because they will remain consistent even
while this privacy policy adapts to rapidly changing privacy laws and our
understanding of them.

If you have any questions about any of these principles, or any part of our
privacy policy, you can email them to us at
[arizona@saintschorale.org](mailto:arizona@saintschorale.org).
