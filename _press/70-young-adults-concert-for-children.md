Brighten your family’s holiday season with a free Christmas concert! The Arizona Saints Chorale, a local nonprofit choir, will present “Light of the World” at the First United Methodist Church in downtown Mesa. The production runs for two nights, Friday and Saturday Dec. 15-16, starting at 7 p.m. No tickets are required for this free event, and all donations benefit local charities.

Last year’s show filled up quickly, so claim a seat at this holiday highlight as early as 6:30 p.m.

The performance will premiere a touching new version of family favorite "White Christmas" alongside brand-new songs including "Love Came Down at Christmas". Audience members will also enjoy energetic pieces like Pentatonix's cover of "O Come, All Ye Faithful" and Edward Elgar's historical classic "Light of the World".
This event is the Chorale's tenth biannual concert. Proceeds will be shared with the local nonprofit Raising Special Kids which "exists to improve the lives of children with the full range of disabilities."

Organized in 2018 by then 21-year-old Forrest Chapin II and eight friends, the Arizona Saints Chorale is now an official 501(c)(3) nonprofit with over 70 volunteer musicians dedicated to raising awareness for noble Valley charities and uniting the community through song.
