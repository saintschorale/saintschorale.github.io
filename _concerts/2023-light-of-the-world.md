Bring your family and friends to the Arizona Saints Chorale's Winter 2023
concert "Light of the World"! The free event will feature a festive mix of
traditional and contemporary music, including the premiere of multiple original
compositions.

In response to last concert's overwhelming attendance, this semester's
production will run for two nights for the first time ever!

Proceeds from both performances will be shared with [Raising Special
Kids](https://raisingspecialkids.org/) which "exists to improve the lives of
children with the full range of disabilities."

We are also excited to announce that [the Chorale is now an official 501(c)(3)
nonprofit](https://apps.irs.gov/pub/epostcard/dl/FinalLetter_93-3531070_THESAINTSCHORALEINC_09212023_00.pdf), meaning your generous donations are now tax-deductible!
