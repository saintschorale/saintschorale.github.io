Bring your family and friends to the Arizona Saints Chorale's Spring 2024
concert "Let There Be Light"! The free event will feature a festive mix of
traditional and contemporary music, including the premiere of multiple original
compositions.

The Chorale continues to grow its influence. Following the success of the
[Winter 2023 concert]({% link _concerts/2023-light-of-the-world.md %}) we will
again run the production over two separate nights: one performance in Phoenix, AZ
and another in Mesa, AZ.

Proceeds from both performances will be shared with [Lily's
Pad](https://lilyspadaz.org/) which creates hyper-clean play spaces for
immunocompromised children.

We are also excited to announce that [the Chorale is now an official 501(c)(3)
nonprofit](https://apps.irs.gov/pub/epostcard/dl/FinalLetter_93-3531070_THESAINTSCHORALEINC_09212023_00.pdf),
meaning your [generous donations]({% link donate.html %}) are now tax-deductible!
